## Technical Architecture

### System Components
<!-- Document the key components involved in this implementation -->

### Data Flow
<!-- Describe how data moves through the system -->

### Integration Points
<!-- List external systems, APIs, or modules this change interacts with -->

## Sequence Diagrams
<!-- Use mermaid or ASCII diagrams to illustrate key interactions -->

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Actor
    participant S as System
    Note over A,S: Add your sequence diagram here
```

## Implementation Considerations

### Approach
<!-- Describe the overall approach taken to implement the spec -->

### Technical Constraints
