# Specification: Align System Prompt

## User Intent
Align `GEMINI.md` with the tool's generated system prompt while preserving local environment overrides in `AGENTS.local.md`.

## Relevant Context
* `GEMINI.md`
* `AGENTS.local.md`
* `cdd init --system-prompt`

## Context Analysis
The user wants `GEMINI.md` to be "pure" (generated by the tool) but needs to keep their local `go run` commands active. `AGENTS.local.md` is the designated place for these overrides.

## Test Reference
* Manual verification of file contents.
