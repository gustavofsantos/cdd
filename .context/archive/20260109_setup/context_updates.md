Initialized Global Context for the `cdd` project.
- Mapped project structure (Go/Cobra).
- Identified key directories: `cmd/cdd` (entry), `internal/cmd` (logic).
- Identified lack of tests.
- Populated `product.md`, `tech-stack.md`, `patterns.md`, `workflow.md`.
- **Dogfooding**: Established convention to run `go run cmd/cdd/main.go` to use the latest version of the tool during development.
