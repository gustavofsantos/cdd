- Moved prompt files from `internal/cmd/prompts/` to a root `prompts/` directory.
- Renamed prompts from `.txt` to `.md`.
- Created a new `prompts` Go package at root to handle embedding, bypassing Go's restriction against `../` in `//go:embed` patterns.
- Updated `internal/cmd/init.go` to use the new `prompts` package.
